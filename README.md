====================

A theme for listing sites available on a network installation of WordPress. It looks like this:

Personally, I use this theme on my main network site, so I can simply visit any of my other network sites by heading to the URL where I set up WordPress, without having to remember the URL of individual network sites.

Features
--------
* Display a list of your network sites on the home page of your network.
* Rapidly search and filter the sites without refreshing the page.
* Your filtering criteria is always remembered.
* Customize how the sites are displayed using the WordPress Customizer.
* Hook into the theme to make changes without editing the theme.

Installation
------------
1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/tomslominski/list-network-sites/releases) from GitHub.
2. Upload the folder to your 'wp-content/themes/' directory and rename it to 'list-network-sites'.
3. Enable the theme in Network Settings, either for your main site or network wide.
4. Activate the theme on your main site and configure it in the Customizer.

Upgrade
-------
Follow the first two steps of the Installation process, making sure to rename the folder to what it was named previously.
