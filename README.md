# List Network Sites
A theme for listing sites available on a network installation of WordPress. It looks like this:

To install it, download the latest release or ZIP of the master branch, copy it to your WordPress themes directory and enable it on one of your sites as you would with any other theme.

Personally, I use this theme on my main network site, so I can simply visit any of my other network sites by heading to the URL where I set up WordPress, without having to remember the URL of individual network sites.
